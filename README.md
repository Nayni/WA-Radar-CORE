# WA_Radar
A radar for World of Warcraft written for WeakAuras

Idea of this module came from looking at the implementation of [ekardnah](http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/742395-ekardnah) the module can be found on [mmo-champion](http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1839869-Raid-HUD-plotter-for-WeakAuras).
What this implementation tries to do is expand on the idea and add more features and even easier extensions.

# STILL BEEING ACTIVELY DEVELOPED!
